# Be_centrifugal_analysis.py – Centrifugal Separation

Tools for analysing the centrifugal separation of laser-cooled **Be⁺** ions and sympathetically-cooled **e⁺** ions at cryogenic temperatures.

Originally written in 2015, this fork revives and expands the codebase with:

* **Elliptical & circular fitting** after coordinate transformation – provides a more accurate Be⁺ radial profile.
* **Advanced background suppression** – improves signal-to-noise in low-count images.
* **Arbitrary-direction intensity plots** – generate 1-D profiles along any user-defined axis.
* **Hollowness metrics** – automatic calculation of quantitative hollowness factors.
